LAB Setup
Let's talk about the company that we're going to represent, so Globomantics. 
We're going to all be the IT administrators for Globomantics. 
Our core daily task is to execute PowerShell scripts. These are often time‑consuming tasks. 
We have to copy them to each server, and then we have to execute them locally, so there has 
to be a better way. So we simply need a process to execute these effectively, remotely on other 
machines without having to go through that same process again and again and again. 

Now to help us do this, in my lab environment that represents Globomantics, I have an 
- Active Directory server
- File server
- Administration workstation that's running Windows 10
- Sdministration workstation that's running Linux, and we're using Ubuntu Linux for this. 

And the idea behind this is to represent a cross‑section of all of the servers in our infrastructure 
that we would have at Globomantics. So what do you need in order to do this? 
Well, first off, you need that Globomantics lab setup or something similar. 

Maybe your production environment is the same, or maybe you have a test environment. 
You need to have installed PowerShell 7, so at least we have that in those environments, 
then installed a PowerShell editor, and there the two that I like to pick are Visual Studio Code 
or the new Windows Terminal. Either of those are fine. And then of course, you'll need connection 
details for the remote machines themselves, so things like the IP address or the name, and then, 
of course, the credentials that you wish to connect to.
