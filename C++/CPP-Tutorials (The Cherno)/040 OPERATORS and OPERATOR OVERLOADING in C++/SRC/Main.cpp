// Operator
// An operator is basically some kind of symbol that we use usually instead of a 
// function to perform something, so i'm not just talking about mathemtical
// operators that we have such as +, - and / you know multiply all that kind
// of stuff but we've also got other operstors that we use very commonly and we've 
// actually been using quite a few allready.
// These include things like the dereference operator, the arrow operator, the +=.
// There's the ampersand (&) operator that we use for memory addresses.
// We've also been using the bit shift left operator which is two left angular brackets 
// for printing out stuff into our set out our console

// Operator overloading
