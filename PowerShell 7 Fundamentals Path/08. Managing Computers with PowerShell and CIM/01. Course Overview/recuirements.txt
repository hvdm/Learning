Since this is a Powershell 7 course, the Get-WMIObject can't be used
because that isn't part of the PowerShell Core.

You need to switch back to Powershell 5.1

in VScode -> In the terminal Window -> Click the dropdown right next to the + icon.
Select "Select Default Profile" and choose Windows Powershell
